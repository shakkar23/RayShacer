# RayShacer
Ray tracer that renders an NxNxN world purely on the CPU.

It's pretty slow, it uses as many cores that are available, and can be toggled to use only one thread for debugging purposes.

# Controls
* Mouse: look around
* WASD: move parallel to the world "floor"
* Space: move up
* Shift: move down
# Current Features
* NxNxN world with two block types
	* mirror
	* stone
# Future Features
* more block types
* textures on the stone
* GPU processing with OpenGL and GLSL shaders maybe
